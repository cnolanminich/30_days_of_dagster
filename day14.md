# Day 14

Let's set aside the code we've developed so far to explore conditional data pipelines.

Create a pipeline with 3 assets, asset A, asset B, and asset C. Asset A should return a number greater than 10 70% of the time. The other 30% of the time, it should return a number less than 10. If A is great than 10, asset B should execute. If A is less than 10, asset C should execute.
