# Day 12 

Update the penguin pipeline from day 10 to have a few more steps:

1. An asset summarizing the count of penguins by species
2. An asset with the max attribute for each species
3. An asset with the min attribute for each species

Make it easy to re-run assets 2 and 3 in this pipeline for only one species, or to run those assets for each species in parallel.
